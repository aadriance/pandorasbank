I'll be honest, I'm not really looking for help on adding features. Until we hit beta the plan is
to keep the app pretty minimal since big churn in save format is expected each release.

If you encounter a bug and personally fix it though please do submit a PR with the bug and
and explanation of the fix.

I appreciate your desire to help!
