# Pandora's Bank

This app can help you manage Elestrals Awakened saves and Elestrals, and allows for some fun customization options like
gender selection for the player and Elestrals Nicknames.

## Features

- Back up and restore of saves
- Player Gender Selection
- Ability to import/export elestrals to a "bank" file
- Elestrals nickname updates

## Installation

Download from the releases page for your platofrm. Move it to your desited location.

## Updates

Pandora's Bank keeps settings and the bank file next to the executable. Dropping a new executable
over the old should update it just fine.

## FAQ

> My computer says this is a virus / not trusted. Is it safe to use?

I will not provide advice on circumventing your computers security systems. It's up to the end user to
determing if they trust this app and do the research to allow it with their particular set-up.

> The UI is bad

Correct.

> Can you add sprites from the game?

Maybe. I have inquired about Elestrals polic on ripping and/or re-distributing the sprites from the game.

> Will you support Elestrals across future game versions?

Hopefully. Since I don't know what will happen to the game and save data as development progresses I can't
promise anything for sure. I would like to do my best to enable this though.

> Can you add Elestral gen-ing/data editing.

Not at this time. With prealpha being what it is it would be a waste of effort/time in my opinion and I don't want to mantain it for prealpha when it'll
almost certainly be thrown away when alpha comes around.

> Why doesn't my female character have a dodge animation?

Yeh, it's missing so she just zooms while standing. Everything else about her seems to be fine though.

> Linux / Steam Deck support when?

In theory the app will work on linux. I've not been able to set up a linux gaming environment to test it though. I'd be happy
to enable releases for it though if someone in the community does the confirmation work for me and tells me where the default
save location is.
