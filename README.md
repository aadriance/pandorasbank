> users/YOURUSER/AppData/LocalLow/DefaultCompany/ElestralsAwakened-Playtest/gamesave.json
> by default.

## Features

- Back up and restore of saves
- Player Gender Selection
- Ability to import/export elestrals to a "bank" file
- Elestrals nickname updates

## Installation

Download from the releases page for your platofrm. Move it to your desited location.

Note: The linux build is funcitonal but untested.

## Updates

Pandora's Bank keeps settings and the bank file next to the executable. Dropping a new executable
over the old should update it just fine.

## FAQ

> My computer says this is a virus / not trusted. Is it safe to use?

I will not provide advice on circumventing your computers security systems. It's up to the end user to
determing if they trust this app and do the research to allow it with their particular set-up.

> The UI is bad

Correct.

> Can you add sprites from the game?

Maybe. I have inquired about Elestrals polic on ripping and/or re-distributing the sprites from the game.

> Will you support Elestrals across future game versions?

Hopefully. Since I don't know what will happen to the game and save data as development progresses I can't
promise anything for sure. I would like to do my best to enable this though.

> Can you add Elestral gen-ing/data editing.

Not at this time. With prealpha being what it is it would be a waste of effort/time in my opinion and I don't want to mantain it for prealpha when it'll
almost certainly be thrown away when alpha comes around.

> Why doesn't my female character have a dodge animation?

Yeh, it's missing so she just zooms while standing. Everything else about her seems to be fine though.

> Why does my Elestral not follow me in the overworld?

Nicknamed elestrals do no have an overworld model. It appears the game uses the nickname field for overworld models.
(Yes if you change the name to another Elestral it will look like it in the overworld).
Simply change the Elestral name back to see it in the overworld.

> Where is the save button?

Saves are automatic as edits are made.
